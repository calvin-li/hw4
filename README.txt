Start the viewer with ".\OpenGLExample". The default hippo will be shown. If hippo.obj is not in the same folder, then the viewer will not launch properly. 
The rest of the controls are fairly straightforward. All angles are in degrees. This program supports phi values greater than 90 degrees (The camera will be upside down). It also supports values of color that are greater than one; the light will just be brighter. Large enough values of RGB will result in a completely white shape.
Clicking "refresh" (or pressing return while editing any text box) will update the picture based on all the on screen parameters.

This program has the added feature of selecting between smooth and Phong shading via dropdown menu. 
Also, if the file chosen is "cube.obj" then the cube will be rendered with the "dice_texture2.bmp" texture. Note that this texture has been slightly modified from the default one provided, so it is important to use the correct bitmap.
Finally, the user can control the camera by clicking and dragging the picture.
